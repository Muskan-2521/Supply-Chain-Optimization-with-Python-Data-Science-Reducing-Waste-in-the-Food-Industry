### Project Summary
 
As part of an internal analytics initiative at FreshRoute Logistics Ltd., a national food distribution company operating six warehouses across the United Kingdom, I conducted an in-depth analysis to identify operational inefficiencies in the supply chain. By simulating real-world data and applying statistical and predictive techniques, I identified key drivers of spoilage and exposed regional disparities. I proposed data-driven recommendations to reduce waste and improve delivery performance.


### Problem Statement
 
FreshRoute Logistics Ltd. was experiencing higher-than-expected spoilage rates across several locations. While average delays were within acceptable thresholds, losing perishable inventory suggested hidden inefficiencies. This project sought to answer:

- How strongly are delivery delays contributing to spoilage?

- Which regions are underperforming, and why?

- What data-driven actions can reduce operational waste and improve service reliability?

### Methodology

I used Python to simulate 300 delivery records of supply chain data consisting of delivery delays (days) and spoilage rate(%) for six FreshRoute Logistics Warehouse locations: Edinburgh, Manchester, Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, and London. The product categories included fruits, vegetables, Dairy, and Meat.  

```Python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

np.random.seed(42)

# Define FreshRoute's warehouse locations
warehouses = ['Edinburgh', 'Manchester', 'Birmingham', 'Bristol', 'Leeds', 'London']

# Simulate 300 delivery records
n = 300
data = {
    'Warehouse': np.random.choice(warehouses, size=n),
    'Product_Category': np.random.choice(['Fruit', 'Vegetables', 'Dairy', 'Meat'], size=n),
    'Delivery_Delay_Days': np.random.exponential(scale=1.5, size=n).round(1),
}
```
### Tools and Technologies used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn); Data Simulation & Analysis (Random, Matplotlib)
- Machine Learning (Linear Regression and Correlation Analysis)
- Visualisation (Plotly, matplotlib, and Seaborn)
- Notebook Environment: Jupyter

### Data analysis
- Find the Relationship between delivery delay and spoilage percentage

```Python
- import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
- Correlation heatmap
sns.heatmap(df[['Delivery_Delay_Days', 'Spoilage_Percentage']].corr(), annot=True)
plt.title("Correlation Between Delay and Spoilage")
plt.show()
```
- Find out the spoilage percentage per warehouse

```Python
# Boxplot to show the Spoilage by warehouse
sns.boxplot(x='Warehouse', y='Spoilage_Percentage', data=df)
plt.title("Spoilage Distribution by Warehouse Location")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()
```

### Key Findings

- There was a Positive correlation (~0.91) between delay and spoilage, which means that as the delivery delay increases, the spoilage also increases.

- Regional disparities existed: Edinburgh and London had significantly lower spoilage, while Birmingham and Bristol experienced higher spoilage despite similar delays.

### Results and Recommendations

- Short-term:

   - Edinburgh & London demonstrated best operational consistency; practices should be documented and scaled.

   - Bristol & Birmingham require intervention: delivery scheduling improvements and cold chain enhancements.


- Mid-term:

  - Introduce a predictive model: Spoilage Risk Classifier.
Goal: Predict whether a shipment is "High Risk" (likely to result in spoilage above a critical threshold, say 70%) before it arrives, using known pre-delivery metrics such as delay forecasts, region, and product type.

:) Importance: Allows operational teams to intervene proactively (reroute, repackage, prioritise delivery).

- Example in use case:

The shipment of dairy to Birmingham was delayed by 3.2 days, and the expected arrival is on Friday.
The model predicts a 74% probability of high spoilage.

- As a result:
    - Alert sent to the cold storage team.
    - The dispatch team reprioritises delivery or reroutes to the nearby warehouse.

### Next Steps

(i) Incorporate external features: temperature, traffic, and weather forecasts to improve the model.

(ii) Calibrate the model per warehouse to allow location-specific tuning.

### Conclusion:

This project gave me practical experience in using data analytics to solve real-world supply chain challenges. I learned how to simulate meaningful data, uncover relationships between delays and spoilage, and build a predictive model to flag high-risk shipments. One key challenge was balancing realistic data generation with model performance, but it taught me the importance of domain knowledge and clear communication. Iâ€™m excited to apply these skills to real business problems where data can drive efficiency and reduce waste.
